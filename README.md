Overwatcher component - receives, aggregates and archives sensor node data and provides a nice API to query the current states.

This is a C# wewrite of legacy TypeScript version, created to allow for more testability and maintainability.

## Software Stack

We use asp.net core web framework (in Web API configuration specifically). InfluxDB is also used to store historical sensor node state values, as well as raw telemetry.

The architecture is not object oriented per se, but more service oriented, as dictated by asp.net core dependency injection framework. (see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection) for more info about dependency injection in asp.net core)

## How to build & run

First, you would need to setup an InfluxDB instance used for telemetry storage. You should put [connection string](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-csharp/tree/master/Client#client-connection-string) into [asp.net core configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration) under key `SensorInfluxDB` (for example in `appsettings.Development.json`)

Then you can proceed with building and running:

```bash
dotnet run
```
